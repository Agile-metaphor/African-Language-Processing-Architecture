# African-Language-Processing-Architecture
Attempt at an AI language processing system that could to provide robust solutions for African language translation and speech processing. Specifically, my goals include creating a network that can perform: Speech-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech and Text-to-Text Translation with Automatic Speech Recognition with a better accuracy than existing solutions.
Initial focus on creating a small scale working prototype using Bibeli-Mimo of the yoruba language, before attempting a larger scale protoype based on the ÌròyìnSpeech dataset.

Current stage - training small scale text to speech based on Bibeli Mimo
